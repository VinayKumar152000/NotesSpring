//testing with framework
what we have todo-> preparation,provide test inputs,provide expected output
//junit handles these thingsfor us -> run the test,verfiy the result,alert the developer on failing orsuccess

problems with junit4
way too older,not upto date with new testingpattern,not upto date with new java features,have monolithic architecture,bugs
and feature request got piled up

Junit5!=Junit4 + 1.(it follows while diff approach)

Junit5 architecure-> consist of platform-> it consist of libraries which helps in running test cases. we interact with platform
with junit api i.e jupiter
vintage-> helps to runs older test cases based on older version of junit
->>extends-> allows to write custom test cases api and make use of platform to run test cases
--> ide's use platform to run testcases
