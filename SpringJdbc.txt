spring jdbc provide jdbc templateclasss  to perform operation on db. we need object of this class to peform operations.

problems with simple jdbc-
we need to write lot of code -> need to create connection object each time,jdbc template handles this.
-> exception handling -> we need to use try catch for each operation in jdbc, as all exception are checked.


Autowring- feature of spring in which spring container automatically inject dependencies.

works only for reference type values not for primtive types.
