Springmvc- sub framework of spring framework.
-> built on the top of servlet api(internally uses servlet concepts)
-> follows mvc pattern(model,view,controller)
-> implements or follows are spring core principles inverson of control,dependency injection etc.

why spirng mvc- 
-> follows mvc pattern, make code clean and modular.
-> helps in rapid application development.
-> follow features like ioc, dependency injection(makes app loosely coupled),autowring etc.

working of spring mvc->
client send req to server -> intially we have frontcontroller which handles this request(dispatcher servlet) and it delegate
or redirect the request to a specific controller which is requested and than controller gives back the data and view to
be shown to the client.
controller sends back data and view to frontcontroller and frontcontroller with the help of view resolver adds the data to
view template or resolve the view and than frontcontroller will send back respoonse to the client.


configuring tomcat-> download tomcat and open build path in sts,serach for server and add apache new server and give path
to directory where we have tomcat.
-> run tomcat by searching for server. Hence server is up and running.

creating springmvc web app->
configure dispatcher servlet(which is front controller) -> give its name and mappings
create spring configuration file(where we have bean all like stuff)-> its name must we dispathcerServletname-config file name.
configure view resolver in spirng config file 
create controller and view to show in views folder.


deploy war to tomcat-> create war file by mvn clean install,packaging as war in pom.xml.
and add war file to webapp folder inside apache tomcat.
run the server and hence your application is deployed.
