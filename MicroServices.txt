Service Discovery-> two models to discover service. (service disocovery basically means finding service)
client side disocveery- we have disocovery server acts as intermediatery that communicates with services.
client -----> disocvery server -----> services
all the services are registered on disocovery server
client contacts disocvery server to have url of particular service. and after that client contacts the service to get specific info.

spring cloud uses client side disocovery model.

Server side disocvery--> client ---> disovery server ---> services
client passes message directly to disovery server what it want and than discovery server passes that message to particular service. Hence further operations are performed.


Monolithic Architecture-> in monolithic architecture single application is developed having components and is having common single database and a server. 
problems with monolithic architecure is-> is any component fails whole application fails. 
-> if server fails whole applicatoin is down. 
-> they are not easily sacalable, if application is updated than whole system need to be rebuilt which cost lost of money. 
-> one feature needs to be developed after one. we cannot do parallel feature building.
-> we can only limited no. of technology in case of monolithic application to build it.


SOA -> in it application is breakendown into feature level services(coarse grained architecutre). Each feature acts as a service.
whole application is controlled by a central system.(centralized architecutre). Have single database shared by all services.

Microservies arichtecture=> appliaction is broken down into task level services. features are further divided into fine grained tasks.
microservies are indepenedent and are not controlled by any central sytem.(decentralized arichtecutre)
Each service has it's own db. (we can use multiple teach stacks to buid particular service in it)
